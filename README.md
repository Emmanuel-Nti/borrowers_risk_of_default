| [Borrowers' Risk of Default](Analysing_Risk_of_Default_Nti) | As a data analyst at a bank, I am tasked to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. The main objective of the project is to find out if a customer’s marital status, loan purpose, income level, and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. My bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. | *pandas*, *matplotlib.pyplot* | Practicum by Yandex |
